      "Achieve Positive Cash Flow from Day 1 with properties having Best Rent-to-Price Ratio",
    description:
      "Investing locally often leads to properties with negative cash flow, even with a 20% down payment. For example, a $300,000 property at current interest rates might require additional funds each month to cover the mortgage after rent. Bengal Estates ensures you only invest in properties that provide a positive cash flow, typically yielding 5-7% return on investment from day one. This is rare and challenging to achieve independently. By identifying high-yield properties, we secure investments that immediately start generating income.",
